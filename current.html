    <h1>Currently Working On</h1>
    <p>Aiden is currently working on some passion projects outside of school including a video game on Roblox. The video
      game is based off of the anime "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure" with the idea of Stands and Specs.
      He is the Lead Developer of the project being the Lead Animator/Project Manager for the game itself. There is 7
      other developers working with him including the Owner and Co Owner of the project. Even though
      Aiden mainly does animations for the game, he also does the Sound Design and slight bit of Scripting(Just the
      Nametags in game script).

    <p>The game is not even close to being finished yet but this is a slight sneak peek of the game being made. There is
      many bugs and issues still being fixed by the developers. All of the animations seen in this
      clip were made by Aiden himself. The rigs, map, npcs and models were made by the other developers.</p>
